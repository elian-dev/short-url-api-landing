### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue JS](https://reactjs.org/) - Frontend library

### What I learned

I learned about Vue.js composition API with Typescript, fundamentals and  and how to use transitions in Vue.js

I learned about Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in Vue.js in order to do tests locally.

And also, I created a intermediate server using Node.js and Express to do requests to the cleanuri.com API in order to avoid some CORS issues.
